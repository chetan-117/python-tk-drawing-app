# python-tk-drawing-app

<h4>
this drawing app is made using the tkinter library 
<bold>its features are</bold>
    <ul>
        <li>
            it uses a rawTurtle that will be the pointer with which we will draw stuff 
        </li>
        <li>
            the canvas is provided by the tkinter itself for the rawTurtle
        </li>
        <li>
            we have to listen to the onclick events and the ondraw events and apply some functionality when that happens
        </li>
        <li>
            to draw circle and other basic shapes, I can add more functions to it. But all the basic 
            functionality with the turtles are there
        </li>
        <li>
            it maintains a list of the commands entered, we can undo it too.
        </li>
        <li>
            that list of commands can then be stored into a file to store the info about how we arrived at this drawing
        </li>
        <li>
            we can read a file that contains all those steps and commands with attributes, then 
            draw everything back on the screen
        </li>
    </ul>
